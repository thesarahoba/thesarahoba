# Hi there, I'm Sarah Oba

I’m a front-end engineer with 2+ years of experience building modern web and mobile applications.

My core stack includes **React, React Native, Next.js, TypeScript, and Python**, with occasional **Flutter** development.

I specialize in translating product ideas into intuitive, high-performance user experiences.
With experience across both web and mobile ecosystems, I think beyond components, focusing on scalability, architecture, and long-term maintainability.

I enjoy building impactful products, collaborating with cross-functional teams, and continuously sharpening my craft in dynamic environments.
